        <p>Being a self-employed is not easy - in fact, it's so hard that the majority of businesses started by enthusiastic entrepreneurs don't make it past their 2nd year and very few make it to 5 and over! Sadly, many small business owners brave enough to actually give it a shot rarely enjoy the freedom they thought they'd gain by becoming their own boss, or experience the financial benefits that are meant to go hand-in-hand with having a business.</p>
            
        <p>Not to say that this is you, but chances are at least once in a while, you feel the pressure that can come with underwhelming results and disappointing financial rewards. <strong>The Mindset Intensive</strong> is where you learn the <strong>3 critical steps</strong> to breaking through a whole new level - with confidence and clarity. Countless people before you have pointed to the Mindset Intensive as the days that shifted everyhting for them.</p> 
            
        <p>Now is your time to stop sabotaging, procrastinating or overthinking and instead, break through to becoming the powerful, intentional leader you always wanted to be.</p>

        <p>Hello, my sweet friend, my name is Fabienne Fredrickson, and chances are we haven't met yet but my hope is that we're about to change this.</p>
          
        <p>Over the past twenty-something years, I have gone on my own journey in business that probably isn't too dissimilar to yours. Lots of highs, lots of lows, plenty of roadblocks that needed overcoming and all while juggling family, home life and my own dreams and aspirations!</p>
          
        <p>Business, as you know, isn't easy - it finds a way to throw challenges constantly, and every time we think we've figured it out, the game likes to remind us that we have something more difficult to learn. I've overcome all of these challenges, and been a 7-figure business owner for more than 13 years now, by applying powerful mindset principles that work every time.</p>
          
        <p>Hopefully, this where I get to come in for you.</p>
          
        <p>What I know for sure, is that to go up a level or two, we need to spend time with those who've completed them before us. It took me some time to figure out the best way to build my business, but when I did, it was like all the puzzle pieces just clicked in together. Fast forward some, and what we teach and how we teach it has seen my methods featured by the  of Forbes, New York Times, Inc. Magazine and so on. My mindset teachings, the ones I'll be sharing with you during the Mindset Intensive are the ones that thousands of women are using to make millions a year collectively.</p>
          
        <p>The point of my story though is not to say 'look at me', the point is to say that I can help you do amazing things, and we can do it together for free through The Mindset Intensive. If you'll join me, I will teach you things that truly have the power to change your life and improve your business. I know this because I have been doing these events for over 10 years now and the impact for thousands of women in business around the world has been something I'm so proud of.</p>
          
        <p>Life is too short to spend too long figuring out the work/business stuff alone, that lets you lead the life you love with those who matter most. I hope you'll come along...</p>
